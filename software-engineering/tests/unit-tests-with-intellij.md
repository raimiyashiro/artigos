# Unit Testing with IntelliJ Idea

## The principle of Unit Testing
It's never too much to discuss the importance of writing tests before delivering any code. -- by *delivering*, assume that this code will be used by someone, being exposed to different scenarios and interactions. It would allow the user to send different parameters, maybe in an inappropriate order or in an inappropriate way, thus breaking the code unexpectedly.

 Ideally, the developers would do so, going even further: writing their tests yet before working on the code itself. That would be good.

But unfortunately, in many scenarios, developers are too far from reaching the level of maturity in which they would always look for the correct implementation of TDD (Test-Driven Design) workflow. That's why I've decided to avoid writing about this exciting topic today. Let's start simple.
Covering the code with tests -- not only tests but the unit, well-written tests. -- is extremely important to guarantee the quality of what you're delivering. Don't believe in me. If you think that the code you write, the same code that someday will be deployed in production, being used by hundreds, thousands of users, doesn't necessarily *need* to be tested, then you're fine. Keep going on your own, and I truly hope that nothing goes wrong. However, it's my moral obligation to advise you: uncovered code is the most expensive, and dangerous code you'll always deliver to your customers.

// Great, now let's dive into the concept of unit testing.

## Plus: the Spy* case.
